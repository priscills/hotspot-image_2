        <h1>The cost of securing the First-family </h1>
        <h2>By Priscilla Alabi</h2>
        <P class="main-text">
            New York City is paying a litlle over $328,000 a day to keep Trump Tower secure while the first lady and first child remain in New York City. The price is what it costs the New York Police Department to maintain a heavy presence at the foot of the tower.
            <P>
                <P class="main-text">
                    One New Yorker, Douglas McPherson a resident of New York and an urban planner said, “no one wants anything bad to happen to Trump Tower, but if the president is so rich, he should pay to secure the building out of his own pocket. We've got better things
                    to be spending taxpayer money on.”
                </P>

                    NYC realtors started to list the presence of the United States Secret Service as an amenity to lure potential buyers and renters to Trump Tower. This means a select few, those able to afford to rent or buy units in Trump Tower, are benefitting from this
                    added security. This new feature and is one that the vast majority of New York City tax payers who contribute to it do not have access to.

                <P class="main-text">
                    One such tax payer, Levi Johnsen who is a City and Regional Planning student at the Pratt Institute said he thinks that the real story is what it means symbolically: hardworking Americans are footing the bill so “an out-of-touch family can remain in their
                    golden tower strategically removed from the lives of real Americans.”

                    This is an ongoing issue for as long as the Trump family remains in New York City. Tax payers continue to foot the bill for the remainder of the time the first family stays in New York and not in Washington DC, where they belong.

                <P class="main-text">
                    However, some other New Yorkers believe the real story is about the nation’s tax structure as a whole. Katy McFadden, a home owner and tax payer in Brooklyn, New York said “the conversation around this issue assumes that our country has limited resources.
                    We can all have more if we just tax wealthy people the same amount as everyone else.”
